# Components

## Structure & theming

MyneChat has been built using different composable components that rely on a global
theme provider via `Grommet`. As a result, all components inherit a set of default
CSS-styles that are tweaked via our theme. Below you can see an actual
component being rendered and how the `Grommet` wrapper works.

<Canvas>
<Grommet theme={theme}>
  <Analytics myPeerId="16Uiu2HAm6phtqkmGb4dMVy1vsmGcZS1VejwF4YsEFqtJjQMjxvHs" />
</Grommet>
</Canvas>

In reality, you won’t need to do this yourself. The application loads this globally
via `next.js`’s application component located unders `pages/_app.tsx`. The actual application
lives under `pages/index.tsx`, where you will likely do most of the changes.

<div className="tip-wrapper">
  <span className="tip">Tip</span>If you want to change the global design of the site,
  go to <code>src/theme.ts</code> and tweak them as needed.
</div>

Most components inherit native components from `Grommet`, so modification or tweaking them
would require changing the theme file directly. However, in some cases where custom or more
isolated components are needed, we can make usage of `styled` from [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
to define a particular component. For instance, here's the code of a modified component:

<Source
  language='tsx'
  code={`
const StyledButton = styled(Button)\`
  cursor: ${(props) => !props.disabled && 'pointer'};
\`
  `}
/>

In this particular case, we loaded `Button` via `import { Button } from "grommet"` and then
changed the css `cursor` property of that particular component based on whether the `disabled`
property was created or not. This would look more or less like this for the `IconButton` component:

<Canvas style={{ background: theme.global.colors["dark-3"] }}>
<Grommet theme={theme}>
  <IconButton>
    🟢 (Enabled)
  </IconButton>
  <IconButton disabled>
    🔴 (Diabled)
  </IconButton>
</Grommet>
</Canvas>

This last component was rendered with a darker background, which was inherited via `theme.global.colors`.
You can always import the `theme` and use it within your components to make sure they keep the same
brand color across your application.

## Important components

Here's a list of the most relevant components within MyneChat

### Connectivity
- `analytics` - Showcases the PeerId of the component when connected
- `new-conversation` - Adds a new conversation given a PeerId
- `settings` - Updates the HOPRd URL and its API token

### Conversations
- `conversations-panel` - Sidebar holding all the existing conversations

### Chat
- `chat-bubble` - The minimal component that displays a message
- `chat-input` - Wrapper for both inputing and sending the actual message
- `chat-view` - The display of all messages sent and received
- `chat` - The component that wires all other `chat-*` components

### other
- `icon-button` - As described, base component for styling buttons with icons
- `logo` - MyneChat logo, which changes opacity depending on connectivity status

## Reusing components

Most of these components are relevant only for chat-like applications. If you are
building your own chat, the `chat` component is a good starting point for seeing how
the sending and displaying of messages work.

The `conversations-panel` is a selector of conversations, but also contains all the
connectivity components which are highly useful to avoid coding again these steps. In
particular, it's useful to showcase the connected HOPR's node PeerId, which is needed to
interact with other HOPR nodes.

In case you are looking to build a HOPR app that is not a chat, your best bet is to reuse
the [state hooks](/) instead.
