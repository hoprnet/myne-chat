# Quickstart

<br/>

## Setting up HOPR cluster

<br/>

### Cloud setup (easiest)

The easiest way to launch MyneChat and setup a cluster of HOPR nodes to start
testing it is via [Gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io). It will automatically fetch
and install all the required dependencies and spin up the needed services for
you to start tweaking MyneChat.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/hoprnet/myne-chat)

After you have done that, you will see a terminal with the addresses of all 
the existing nodes. Click and open any of them to see MyneChat in your
browser. Click on the “Analytics” icon to obtain your "PeerId", and share
it with another user from the terminal. Click on the “Add” icon to start
a conversation with the first user; by typing in the input field and
pressing “enter”, you have effectively sent a private message across your
local HOPR network.

### Local setup (via mocks)

The alternative to launch MyneChat is by running our local `mocks` server,
by running `yarn mocks` after `yarn` locally, and go to our "internal" public
preview URL (https://int-dev-app.myne.chat/?development=enabled) in development mode.
If done correctly, you should be able to see the following component showcasing
a "green"-like enabled icon.

## Using MyneChat

After your cluster is ready, you now only need to start MyneChat. Within a React application,
this means loading the `<HomePage>` component. Then, you can update the application's endpoint
by clicking the gear-like icon, and update the endpoints as needed.

(If you are using the mocks server, you don't need to do anything else. For the cloud setup,
you need to use the REST API endpoint as the `HTTP Endpoint` and Admin URL as the `WS Endpoint`,
making sure to change the URL from `https` to `wss`. Also do not forget the API Token, which
currently defaults to `^^LOCAL-testing-123^^`).

e.g.
```

    MyneChat: https://8080-hoprnet-mynechat-q0d9mzehwlb.ws-us29.gitpod.io/?apiEndpoint=https://13301-hoprnet-mynechat-q0d9mzehwlb.ws-us29.gitpod.io&apiToken=^^LOCAL-testing-123^^
    Rest API:       https://13301-hoprnet-mynechat-q0d9mzehwlb.ws-us29.gitpod.io/api/v2/_swagger
    Admin UI:       https://19501-hoprnet-mynechat-q0d9mzehwlb.ws-us29.gitpod.io/
```

would be

```
HTTP Endpoint: https://13301-hoprnet-mynechat-q0d9mzehwlb.ws-us29.gitpod.io
WS Endpoint: wss://19501-hoprnet-mynechat-q0d9mzehwlb.ws-us29.gitpod.io
Security Token: ^^LOCAL-testing-123^^
```

Feel free to send a message to another user in your local cluster!
